# ❓ What even is that repo

This repository is just [Matcha Gtk Theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Matcha-gtk-theme). I basically took only necessery files from their repo and changed a little bit to adjust theme to my will.

I ended up with just changing accent color to black and replacing gtk theme with default gnome theme (Adwaita).
